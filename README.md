# softwareTesting
Please note, for these tests comparisons between game states were used, with success/failure
indicated in print statements. Asserts were not used. This was a request from the instructor 
and TAs for grading and testing. All data is printed for out for the TA for grading and identification
purpose.

Tests I've created:
Unittest 1 - 4
cardtest 1- 4
randomcardtest
randomadventurer

Coverage Files:
coverage1.c
randomhistory.c
Please note, these files are c files instead of text documents, per instructions. There is
no code within these files that is meant to be implemented.

To Run Unit and Card Tests:
make all
make unittestresults.out

To Run Random Tests:
make randomtestcard.out
