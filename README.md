Dominion Testing Information -

Please note, for these tests comparisons between game states were used, with success/failure
indicated in print statements. Asserts were not used. This was a request from the instructor 
and TAs for grading and testing. All data is printed for out for the TA for grading and identification
purpose.

Tests I've created:
Unittest 1 - 4
cardtest 1- 4
randomcardtest
randomadventurer

Coverage Files:
coverage1.c
randomhistory.c
Please note, these files are c files instead of text documents, per instructions. There is
no code within these files that is meant to be implemented.

To Run Unit and Card Tests:
make all
make unittestresults.out

To Run Random Tests:
make randomtestcard.out
make randomadventurer.out

When complete, please CAT fileName.out to view tests and coverage.




URLValidator Information -

An opensource URL validator was changed by the teacher, so it would contain four bugs. These bugs are are found in the
source code.

URLValidatorTest contains the tests written by myself and two other team members. 

Planning, input partitioning and bugs found can be reviewed int the project report, both in text and PDF.
